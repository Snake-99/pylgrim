 This routine is part of the International Earth Rotation and 
 Reference Systems Service (IERS) Conventions software collection. 

 This subroutine determines the Vienna Mapping Function 1 (VMF1) (Boehm et al. 2006).

    :__________________________________________: 

 In general, Class 1, 2, and 3 models represent physical effects that 
 act on geodetic parameters while canonical models provide lower-level 
 representations or basic computations that are used by Class 1, 2, or 
 3 models. 

 Status: Class 1 model 

    Class 1 models are those recommended to be used a priori in the 
    reduction of raw space geodetic data in order to determine 
    geodetic parameter estimates. 
    Class 2 models are those that eliminate an observational 
    singularity and are purely conventional in nature. 
    Class 3 models are those that are not required as either Class 
    1 or 2. 
    Canonical models are accepted as is and cannot be classified as a 
    Class 1, 2, or 3 model. 

 Given: 
    AH             d      Hydrostatic coefficient a (Note 1) 
    AW             d      Wet coefficient a (Note 1) 
    DMJD           d      Modified Julian Date 
    DLAT           d      Latitude given in radians (North Latitude) 
    HT             d      Ellipsoidal height given in meters 
    ZD             d      Zenith distance in radians 

 Returned: 
    VMF1H          d      Hydrostatic mapping function (Note 2) 
    VMF1W          d      Wet mapping function (Note 2) 

 Notes: 

 1) The coefficients can be obtained from the primary website 
    http://ggosatm.hg.tuwien.ac.at/DELAY/ or the back-up website 
    http://www.hg.tuwien.ac.at/~ecmwf1/. 

 2) The mapping functions are dimensionless scale factors. 

 Test case: 
    given input: AH   = 0.00127683D0 
                 AW   = 0.00060955D0 
                 DMJD = 55055D0 
                 DLAT = 0.6708665767D0 radians (NRAO, Green Bank, WV) 
                 HT   = 824.17D0 meters 
                 ZD   = 1.278564131D0 radians 

    expected output: VMF1H = 3.423513691014495652D0 
                     VMF1W = 3.449100942061193553D0
